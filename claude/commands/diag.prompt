# name: /diag
# description: Print cwd, show git/gh status, and write a test file in scratchpads
# arguments:

Run these commands exactly and print their outputs:

1) pwd
2) ls -la
3) git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree
4) git branch --show-current
5) git remote -v
6) gh auth status

Then ensure ./scratchpads exists:
- mkdir -p ./scratchpads

Write a file so we can verify filesystem access:
- date > ./scratchpads/diag-$(date +%s).txt

Finally, print "WROTE_FILE" and the exact path of the file you wrote on a single line.
